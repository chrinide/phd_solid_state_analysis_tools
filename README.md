# Tools for electronic structure analyses

Handy modules and scripts I wrote for analyzing electronic structures of hybrid organic-inorganic systems. The scripts take in as inputs the OUTCAR, CHGCAR, and PROCAR files of a VASP calculation, and output the energy levels of interest. 4-D band structures are visualized using Pandas, pymatgen, and matplotlib.
